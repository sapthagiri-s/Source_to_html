# Source_to_html
Source_to_html is a C-based lexical parser that reads source code character by character, identifies tokens such as keywords, comments, strings, numbers, headers, and preprocessor directives, and converts them into structured HTML output. It helps visualize and highlight source code syntax in a browser-friendly format.
